        <h1>More about me!</h1>
        <h2>Background </h2>
        <p> I was born on January 6th, 1999 in Ulsan, South Korea and my family moved to the States in 2006. Thanks to my family, I have retained Korean culture and the language, so I am proud to say that I am fluent in both English and Korean.</p>
        <p>While I am currently in Ann Arbor, Michigan for school, I have lived in Bergen County, New Jersey ever since moving here! Back in Jersey, I live with my parents, my older sister, my older brother and sister-in-law, and just over a year ago, I was blessed with the most adorable niece, Ellie!.</p>

        <h2>My inspiration</h2>
        <p>Family is the single most important and valuable thing to me in life. The word itself brings feelings of warmth and a sense of security. I can always count on them, share my problems, and just be myself at anytime. They always provide me with unconditional love and support through the good and the bad.</p>
        <p> Growing up as the youngest I was lucky enough to have received so much love and affection. Family to me encompasses encouragement, understanding, comfort, faith, and so much more. I believe that it's because of them that I am able to reciprocate that love to others, especially to the youngest addition to my family, my baby niece.</p>

        <h2> A few fun facts </h2>
        <p>I have two opposite sides to me. I am a big homebody - I love staying in bed solving puzzles, watching Netflix, and playing phone games. At the same time, once I leave the house, I crave action and adventure. I like to go bowling with my friends and many of them have bought bowling shoes because of me. </p>
        <p>When I travel with family and friends, I prefer outdoor activities such as hiking, parasailing, jetskiing, etc. to going to museums. My lifelong bucketlist includes bungee jumping, skydiving, and paragliding!</p>
