        <h1>More about me!</h1>
        <h2>Background </h2>
        <p> I was born on January 6th, 1999 in Ulsan, South Korea and my family moved to the States in 2006. Thanks to my family, I have retained Korean culture and the language, so I am proud to say that I am fluent in both English and Korean.</p>
        <p>While I am currently in Ann Arbor, Michigan for school, I have lived in Bergen County, New Jersey ever since moving here! Back in Jersey, I live with my parents, my older sister, my older brother and sister-in-law, and just over a year ago, I was blessed with the most adorable niece, Ellie! (Many pictures are coming your way &#9825; ).</p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>Family is the single most important to me in life. They provide me with unconditional love and support every step of the way. Growing up as the youngest, I received so much love and affection, and I believe that it's because of them that I am able to reciprocate that love to others.</p>
        <p>I realize how valuable family is especially when babysitting my baby niece. As much as I love Ellie, I see how much patience it takes to be a parent, and I can't even image what my parents had gone through to raise three kids. Still, at the end of the day, when I see the way my brother and my sister-in-law look at Ellie, I realize that there is nothing more important than family.</p>
